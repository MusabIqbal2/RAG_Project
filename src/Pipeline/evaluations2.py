The IBA Financial Assistance Program is designed to support meritorious students from all socio-economic backgrounds across Pakistan. Between 2008 and 2024, PKR 3.17 billion was granted in financial aid. In the academic year 2023â€“2024 alone, approximately 600 students benefited from financial assistance, and around 170 students received support through Qarz-e-Hasna.
The program offers multiple forms of assistance, including fee installments, Qarz-e-Hasna, and bridge financing (temporary financial relief while awaiting external donor scholarships such as Zakat or government/private sector funding). Eligible students are full-time undergraduates and graduates enrolled in morning programs (excluding EMBA).
The aid can cover 25% to 100% of tuition fees and is based on a need assessment conducted by the Financial Assistance Committee (FAC). Applicants may be required to attend interviews, submit supporting documents, or undergo home verifications. Students must maintain a minimum CGPA of 2.5 to continue receiving support and must reapply annually.
Additionally, financial assistance is only provided for active semester tuition and does not cover arrears, repeated, or withdrawn courses. Misrepresentation or failure to comply with the guidelines can result in revocation of aid and disciplinary action.
For further inquiries, students are advised to contact the Financial Assistance Office at financial-aid@iba.edu.pk or visit https://www.iba.edu.pk/installments to apply.
